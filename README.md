I've been working in publishing making paper products for the last seven years and I want a new challenge. I love creating something from ideas as to how it will look, feel and function. I want to use my problem solving skills and process-focused outlook together with my love of syntax to write beautiful, clean, tested and reusable code.

I am currently a student at [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/), an intensive developer bootcamp. I'm looking for my first junior developer role in a learning-friendly environment where I can be creative and challenged.

## Skills

#### Fast learner

I am quick to learn new technologies and systems. When a new in-house workflow system was introduced at Springer Nature, I put myself forward to be a 'key user', receiving intensive training on the system ahead of its introduction to my department’s workflow. I delivered this training back to colleagues and became the main port of call on our UK site for production-related system queries.

#### Attention to detail

In publishing, production is where the Is are dotted and the Ts crossed. With years of experience in proofreading and supplier quality control management, I have a meticulous eye for detail. Attention to the finer points is also something I have introduced systematically, for example by moving Zed Books' academic titles to an XML-first workflow to improve consistency in layout and quality of referencing.

#### A practical creative

I love approaching tasks creatively, but wear my practical hat while doing so. I am able to turn vague ideas into detailed briefs, ensuring all elements are considered, costed and prepared with sufficient time. These are skills I really honed while at Zed Books. For example, I worked with the art department and external suppliers on how to achieve more sophisticated print finishes, whilst delivering on time and in budget.

#### Highly organised

From handling over 200 titles a year at Palgrave Macmillan to being on the board of directors at Zed Books, planning, strategising and organising are some of my key strengths. Years of scheduling months ahead, as well as being able to accommodate last minute changes, will prove excellent preparation for life as a developer: being able to see the big picture and how things will slot together but with the flexibility to respond to changes.

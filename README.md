I am itching to start my career as a web developer - I love the constant problem solving, iterative processes, continuous learning and opportunities to collaborate.

With a background in publishing, I love building something from ideas as to how it will look, feel and function. I want to use my problem solving skills and process-focused outlook together with my love of syntax to write clean, tested and reusable code.

I am currently a student at [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/), an intensive developer bootcamp. I'm looking for my first developer role in a learning-friendly environment where I can be creative and challenged.

## Skills

#### Fast and continuous learner

I am quick to learn new technologies and systems. When a new in-house workflow system was introduced at Springer Nature, I put myself forward to be a 'key user'. After receiving intensive training on the system, I delivered this back to colleagues and became the main port of call on our UK site for production-related system queries.

At Makers Academy, I have picked up quickly new technical skills, as well as ways of working. This has included learning new technical frameworks in a group environment.

#### Collaboration

I am an advocate for Agile - for efficiency, adaptability and to ensure quality - and pair programming - to learn, to teach, to share and upskill, and to make clean code. I find both of these ways of working to be invaluable to me individually as well as in the teams I have worked in, increasing productivity, buy-in and facilitating group and individual learning.

#### Problem solving

From breaking down a business problem into manageable chunks while at Zed Books to developing an effective debugging technique while at Makers, excellent problem breakdown and solving skills will be at the core of my work as a web developer. I have deconstructed challenges during the bootcamp into detailed user stories and established acceptance criteria. Breaking the problem down into manageable specifications has driven the code and tests I need to write, and led to a cleaner and more efficient solution.

#### Attention to detail

In publishing, production is where the Is are dotted and the Ts crossed. With years of experience in proofreading and supplier quality control management, I have a meticulous eye for detail. Attention to the finer points is also something I have introduced systematically, for example by moving Zed Books' academic titles to an XML-first workflow to improve consistency in layout and quality of referencing.

#### Practical and creative

I love approaching tasks creatively, but wear my practical hat while doing so. I am able to turn vague ideas into detailed briefs, ensuring all elements are considered, costed and prepared with sufficient time. These are skills I really honed while at Zed Books. For example, I worked with the art department and external suppliers on how to achieve more sophisticated print finishes, whilst delivering on time and in budget.

#### Highly organised

From handling over 200 titles a year at Palgrave Macmillan to being on the board of directors at Zed Books, planning, strategising and organising are some of my key strengths. Years of scheduling months ahead, as well as being able to accommodate last minute changes, will prove excellent preparation for life as a developer: being able to see the big picture and how things will slot together but with the flexibility to respond to changes.
